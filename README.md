A guided hands-on activity for the **Advanced Python Programming**.  
Students add a production-quality cache layer to a Django REST API, level by level.

## What You'll Build

A caching layer for a blog API that handles:
- Shared cache for public data (all posts)
- User-isolated cache for personal data (drafts)
- Cache invalidation on data mutation
- Identifying and explaining a real cache security bug

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone <repo-url>
cd smart-cache-activity

# Virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

# Install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Setup & seed
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py seed

# Run
python manage.py runserver
```

| 1 — Feel the Pain | Baseline timing, no cache | `timing.py` |
| 2 — Shared Cache | Cache-aside for public endpoints | `blog/views.py` |
| 3 — User-Isolated Cache | Per-user keys + bug spotting | `blog/views.py` |
| 4 — Invalidation | Cache busting on data mutation | `blog/views.py` |
| Stretch — Query-Aware Keys | Paginated / filtered cache keys | `blog/views.py` |

## Cache Configuration

This activity uses **LocMemCache** — Django's in-process memory cache.

- No Redis install required
- Zero configuration — works out of the box
- Cache clears every time you restart the server (expected behaviour)

The cache is configured in `config/settings.py`:
```python
CACHES = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache",
        "LOCATION": "smart-cache-activity",
    }
}
```
